# Problem 1.b: Write a function that, given a Polygon's path of points, 
# returns a reduced list that defines the same Polygon. 
# (Notice that all the points in the set are adjacent). 
# Choose the language you want to answer this question, 
# and comment on the code explaining each step. 
# Donâ€™t worry about syntaxes.


def reduced_polygon(points_list):
    """
    Find the points that don't change the polygon which are the ones in the same line that another 2 points could make,
    aka, useless points and return a clean list
    A point will be in the same line as another line if either:
        the x values of the points before and after are the same as itself
        the y values of the points before and after are the same as itself

    Parameters: 
    points: list of tuples, where the first value of each tuple is the x value and the second value of each tuple is the y values

    Returns: 
    list of tuples without the useless points

    Examples:
    sample_points_1 = [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1)] 
    # useless points (1,2), (3,3)
    # reduced_polygon(sample_points_1) = [(1, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1)]
